1. What new insights came out of the discussion?

Top-down and bottom-up analysis shine depending on the use case/purpose they were written for. Top-down is a cleaner approach for analyzing a system abstractly, while bottom-up may catch many implementation details and problems that top-down abstracts away.

2. Was there disagreement? Why?

People had different favorite design principles and a wide variety of defences for their favorites. Out of the class, I think every design principle had a couple backers.

3. What was the consensus about the work?

Everyone agreed that this paper and the concepts introduced are fundamental elements of protection engineering today, and that you can see elements of the design principles show up in the OS designs we've been discussing throughout the semester.
